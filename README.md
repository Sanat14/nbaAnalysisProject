## Overview

The NBA project aims to explore various aspects of basketball through data analysis, with the
goal of providing insights into player performance, team strategies, and game outcomes. Through
meticulous examination of player statistics, team dynamics, and game trends, the project seeks to
answer four key research questions:
1) Who are the greatest scorers, playmakers, and defenders of all time?
2) What factors impact draft/trade strategies the most?
3) Has the level of the NBA gotten worse or better?
4) Which performance stats contribute to determining a team’s success the most?
