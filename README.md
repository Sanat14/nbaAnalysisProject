## Overview

The NBA project aims to explore various aspects of basketball through data analysis, with the
goal of providing insights into player performance, team strategies, and game outcomes. Through
meticulous examination of player statistics, team dynamics, and game trends, the project seeks to
answer four key research questions:
1) Who are the greatest scorers, playmakers, and defenders of all time?
2) What factors impact draft/trade strategies the most?
3) Has the level of the NBA gotten worse or better?
4) Which performance stats contribute to determining a teamâ€™s success the most?


## Data
All data can be found in the "data" directory where we have raw data (run notebooks in the "collecting data" folder to retrieve raw data, although only cleaned data is required to run the main analysis notebooks) and cleaned data.

## Analysis/Visualisations
Analysis on our research questions can be found in the "analysis_visualisations" directory.
